# DLR

DLR is a compact, common runtime for deep learning models and decision tree models compiled by [AWS SageMaker Neo](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/neo/), [TVM](https://tvm.ai/), or [Treelite](https://treelite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). DLR includes the TVM runtime,  Treelite runtime, NVIDIA TensorRT™, and can support other contributed runtimes. DLR provides unified Python/C++ APIs for loading and running compiled models on devices based on ARM® Cortex-A™, Intel® Atom™, Intel® Xeon™, and Nvidia® Jetson™ processors.
